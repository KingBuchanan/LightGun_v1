# LightGun_v1
A IR transmitter gun that can turn the lights on and off.
    For version 1 focused on decoding the IR signal found by an old IR gun. The transmitter inside takes two AA batteries and transmits the equivalent of a "1". 
       # Features to be added 
       Further customization will be added in slowly. This code works only with a Hue light bridge as the intermediary but would like to add some API calls for other devices such as speakers or music streaming when gun is shot.
